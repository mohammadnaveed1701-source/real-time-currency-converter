# real-time-currency-converter
💱 Currency Converter

A responsive Currency Converter web application that converts amounts between multiple international currencies using real-time exchange rates. The project demonstrates frontend development skills, asynchronous JavaScript, API integration, and dynamic UI updates.

📌 Project Overview

This application allows users to convert currency values by selecting source and target currencies from dynamically populated dropdowns. Exchange rates are fetched in real time from a public currency API, and corresponding country flags update automatically based on currency selection.

The project is designed as a practical frontend portfolio project suitable for resumes and technical interviews.
